From this foundation we then explore allocation of labour (4) and capital (5) through market and non-market institutions, moving onto closed system models of resource allocation (6). We also graduate from seeking to understand how economic institutions work to evaluating how well they work through cost-benefit analysis (7). The next step is to understand how economies operate as closed (8) and open-ended systems (9). This takes us finally to a comprehensive framework for understanding the microeconomic determinants of economic growth, structural change, inequality, poverty and exclusion at national and global levels (10). Each lecture will be illustrated with reference to examples from low and middle income countries, and reflect on how the context of poverty, inequality, weak infrastructure and governance affects the operation of market and non-market institutions of resource allocation\n\n---\n- Index:: [[University of Bath]]\n- Related:: [[Economics]]\n- Year:: 1\n- Semester:: 2 \n---","lastmodified":"2022-08-24T07:25:01.119887362Z","tags":null},"/.trash/SP10204-An-introduction-to-international-development":{"title":"","content":"\n- Unit Code:: [[SP10204 An introduction to international development|SP10204]]\n- Title:: An introduction to international development (*==OPTIONAL==*)\n- ECTS Credits:: 6 credits (equivalent to 12 CATS credits)\n- Assessment:: Coursework (20%), Portfolio (80%)\n- Requisites::\n- Aims:: The course unit provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of International Development and familiarises students with some of its key issues, concepts and methods.\n- Learning Outcomes:: \n\t- Have a clear understanding of the range of issues raised by International Development\n\t- Have a clear grasp of certain key concepts and methods used in the study and practice of Development\n\t- Be able to apply these in the analysis of development contexts\n- Skills:: \n\t- Critical analysis of texts\n\t- Clear and logical expression, oral and written\n\t- Critical reflection on own experience and connections across text and context\n- Content::\n\t- The four components of International Development: the 'international';

This note is about ledgers in [[Cryptocurrency]]\n\nProtocol:\n1. Anyone can add entries to the ledger\n2. Only signed transactions are valid\n3. Overspending is impossible\n4. Proof of work\n5. Blockchain\n\nAs *anyone* can add entries to the ledger (Protocol 1) , some entries can be made such as \"Alice pays Bob $250\" without the consent of Alice in this case. To prevent this from occurring, [[Digital signatures]] are used.\n\nIf the transaction \"Alice pays Bob $250\" has been verified, it is possible for Bob to repeat the same transaction which has already been \"approved\". To prevent this exploit, each [[Digital signatures]] *must* include the ID of the transaction taking place (Protocol 2).\n\nOverdrawing money from the ledger is impossible (Protocol 3) as a transaction where a person spends more than they have is as invalid as if they never signed it. This also means that to verify a transaction, the full transaction history of that particular person must be known.\n\nAn interesting point to note is that if everyone used the ledger, there would be no need for physical cash as ledger entries could be used as proof of payment. Hence, the money listed in the ledger can be put under a different name such as [[Bitcoin]]. ==*The currency is the list of transactions made.*==\n\nTo decentralise the [[Cryptocurrency]], rather than keeping a central ledger, each person maintains their own ledger. When a new transaction takes place, it is broadcast to all other users who then add the entry to their own ledger. The ledger with the most computational work put into it will be agreed upon as the \"correct\" ledger.\n\nThe ledger is grouped into \"blocks\" of transactions. Each block includes a hash which is unique to a particular message or file (i.e. unique to a particular [[Digital signatures]]) and is near impossible to reverse engineer. The hash also completely changes when even a small piece of information is changed so no pattern can be found. Hence when a hash is generated and attached to a block, it can be considered to be a stamp of authenticity and is known as a proof of work. The next block contains the hash of a previous block and forms a chain, creating the term \"blockchain\". The longest blockchain is agreed as the correct one. (Protocol 5)\n\nIf a transaction or the order of blocks is altered, all the subsequent hash functions will change causing the proof of works for all blocks to be recomputed.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)","lastmodified":"2022-08-24T07:25:01.127887359Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration. Operand needs access to GitHub in order to index your digital garden properly!\n4. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar and select 'Create Collection'.\n\t1. Set the 'Collection Label' to something that will help you remember it.\n\t2. You can leave the 'Parent Collection' field empty.\n5. Click into your newly made Collection.\n\t1. Press the 'share' button that looks like three dots connected by lines.\n\t2. Set the 'Interface Type' to `object-search` and click 'Create'.\n\t3. This will bring you to a new page with a search bar. Ignore this for now.\n6. Go back to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e API Keys and find your Quartz-specific Operand API key under 'Other keys'.\n\t1. Copy the key (which looks something like `0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910`).\n\t2. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[notes/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2022-08-24T07:25:01.127887359Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-08-24T07:25:01.127887359Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
