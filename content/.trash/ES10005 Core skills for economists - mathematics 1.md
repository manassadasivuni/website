- Unit Code:: [[ES10005 Core skills for economists - mathematics 1|ES10005]]
- Title:: Core skills for economists: [[Math|mathematics]] 1
- ECTS Credits:: 6 credits (equivalent to 12 CATS credits)
- Assessment:: Exam (100%)
- Requisites:: 
- Aims:: To provide students with knowledge of areas of [[Math|mathematics]] that are relevant to undergraduate [[economics]] and to prepare them for more advanced units in [[economics]] and econometrics.
- Learning Outcomes:: By the end of the course unit, students should be able to understand key mathematical concepts, solve mathematical problems, and apply [[Math|mathematics]] to economic problems.
- Skills:: Students will develop mathematical skills, specifically as listed in the Content section below.
- Content:: 
	- Differentiation: differentiation of functions of one variable: rules of differentiation, stationary points, higher order derivatives, concavity and convexity, point of inflection, differentiation of exponential and logarithmic functions, concepts of marginals and elasticities, single variable optimization problems.
	- Partial Differentiation: differentiation of functions of more than one variable; higher order partial derivatives, total differentials, implicit differentiation, homogeneous functions and Euler's theorem, concepts of marginals and elasticities.
	- Matrices: matrix operations; determinants; matrix inversion; solution of system of linear equations by matrix inversion; Cramer's rule; quadratic forms: definiteness, characteristic root and characteristic vector.
	- Concavity and convexity of functions of more than one variable; unconstrained and constrained optimization problems involving more than one variable.
