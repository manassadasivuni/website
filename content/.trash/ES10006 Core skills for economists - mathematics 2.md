- Unit Code:: [[ES10006 Core skills for economists - mathematics 2|ES10006]]
- Title:: Core skills for economists: [[Math|mathematics]] 2
- ECTS Credits:: 6 credits (equivalent to 12 CATS credits)
- Assessment:: Class test (20%), Exam (80%)
- Requisites:: [[ES10005 Core skills for economists - mathematics 1|ES10005]]
- Aims:: To extend students' knowledge and understanding of [[Math|mathematics]] and the use of mathematical techniques in economic analysis, begun in [[ES10005 Core skills for economists - mathematics 1|ES10005]]. To provide students with knowledge of areas of [[Math|mathematics]] that are relevant to undergraduate [[economics]] and to prepare them for more advanced units in [[economics]] and econometrics.
- Learning Outcomes:: By the end of the course unit, students should be able to understand key mathematical concepts, solve mathematical problems, and apply [[Math|mathematics]] to economic problems.
- Skills:: Students will develop mathematical skills, specifically as listed below
- Content::
	- Integration: indefinite integration as the reverse of differentiation. Definite integration and the area under a curve.
	- Circular functions: cycles, circles and trigonometry; calculus with circular functions; Cartesian and polar coordinates.
	- Complex Numbers: the complex number system; Euler's relation; De Moivre's theorem; complex exponentials and polynomials.
	- Differential Equations: first order linear differential equations with constant coefficient and constant term, dynamics of market price; second order differential equations with constant coefficient and constant term, market model with price expectations.
	- Difference Equations: discrete time, differences; first order difference equations, dynamic stability of equilibrium, the Cobweb model; second order linear difference equations; Samuelson multiplier acceleration interaction model.
	- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: the concept of diagonalisable matrices, calculation of the characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues of symmetric matrices.
	- Simultaneous Differential and Difference Equations: systems of difference and differential equations; solving simultaneous dynamic equations; phase diagrams.
