In [[_Game Theory]], all [[Games]] *must* have a Pareto-optimal outcome. Furthermore, there may be multiple Pareto-optimal outcomes in certain [[Games]].

In [[_Economics]], Pareto optimality just means that resources cannot be allocated in any other way without negatively impacting the [[Utility]] of some economic agent.
