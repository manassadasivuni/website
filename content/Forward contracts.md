> A forward is a contract to deliver a particular good, service, or asset at a future date

An example is a rice farmer making a deal to sell rice to a warehouse once the rice is harvested.

An important part of a forward contract is *that they cannot be escaped*. In other words, *neither party can leave the contract even if they wish to*.

A forex forward can be thought of as a zero coupon bond and the forward rate represents the [[Interest rates]] of the two currencies

$$
\text{Forward rate (¥/\$)} = \text{Spot rate (¥/\$)} \times \frac{1+r_¥}{1+r_\$}
$$
