>[!SUMMARY]+
>Data analytics (also called data science) is the modelling and understanding of the unknown by using raw [[Data]]

Data science involves 3 main disciplines:
1. Machine Learning
2. [[Statistics]]
3. Analytics

The disciplines vary in terms of the amount of decisions you expect to make. Machine learning is suited for a large number of decisions under uncertain conditions whereas [[statistics]] focusses on a small number of decisions. Analytics is for when the number of decisions is unknown and the analysis is  purely exploratory.
