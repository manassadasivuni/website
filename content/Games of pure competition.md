**There can only be two players otherwise the interests won't be exactly opposed.** 
|          |  Rock  | Paper  | Scissors |
|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
|   **Rock**   | $0,0$  | $-1,1$ |  $1,-1$  |
|  **Paper**   | $1,-1$ | $0,0$  |  $-1,1$  |
| **Scissors** | $-1,1$ | $1,-1$ | $0,0$         |

Rock paper scissors is an example of a zero-sum game as regardless of the outcome, the total payoff results in $0$.
