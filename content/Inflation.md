> [!SUMMARY]+
> Inflation is the general rise in the [[Price level]] of an economy over a period of time 

There are two types of inflation:
- [[#Cost-push inflation]]
- [[#Demand-pull inflation]]


## Cost-push inflation
This occurs due to a leftward shift in [[Aggregate supply]] and represents a decrease in the output of an economy due to scarce resources, increased foreign competition, etc.

## Demand-pull inflation
This occurs due to a rightward shift in [[Aggregate demand]] and shows an increase in the level of consumption, investment, [[Government]] expenditure, or net exports of an economy.
