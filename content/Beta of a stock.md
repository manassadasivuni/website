> The beta of a stock ($\beta _i$) represents the strength of the correlation of a stock's returns with the [[stock market]] and is a measure of a stock's volatility

If a stock's beta is 1, the returns will be exactly as volatile as the [[stock market]] as a whole, such as through a market index. If a stock's beta is greater than 1, the returns will be more volatile. Hence, the beta is a good indicator of the short-term performance of a stock rather than the long-term.

The beta can be thought of as the [[Covariance]] between a stock and the market. 

$$
\beta _i = \frac{COV(v_i, v_{market})}{Var(v_{market})}
$$
Where $i$ is a particular stock.

The beta can be 0 or negative for some assets. Gold is an example of a negative beta asset as its returns will decrease when the [[stock market]] and economy are doing well.
