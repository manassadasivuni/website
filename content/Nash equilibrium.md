title: "Nash equilibrium" 
---
> [!SUMMARY]+
> The Nash equilibrium is when all players choose the optimal response - the choice that gives them the maximum chance of winning 

This provides a specific list of actions that players should take to reach the "best" choice. However, the Nash equilibrium only works when *all players are rational and experienced*. There is no incentive for players to deviate from the optimal choice is an equilibrium is expected. When an equilibrium is *not* expected, an incentive to deviate does exist.
