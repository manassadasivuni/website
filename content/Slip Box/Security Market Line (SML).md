> The security market line is an expression showing the relationship between the expected return, $E(R_i)$, and the [[Beta of a stock|beta]], $\beta$. This is part of the [[Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)]]

The equation of the line is:

$$
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta _i \left[ E(R_M)-R_f \right]
$$
where:
- $E(R_i)$ is the expected return of an asset
- $E(R_M)$ is the return on the market portfolio
- $\beta$ is [[Beta of a stock|beta]]
- $R_M$ is the market return 
- $R_f$ is the risk-free rate
