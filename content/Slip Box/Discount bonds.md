> A discount bond is a bond that is issued for less than its actual value

$$
P = \frac{1}{(1+r)^T}
$$
Where:
- $P$ is the price of the bond
- $r$ is the [[Yield to maturity]] 
- $T$ is the number of years until maturity

As bonds typically pay interest every 6 months, the above formula is modified to 

$$
P = \frac{1}{\left( 1+\dfrac{r}{2} \right)^{2T}}
$$
