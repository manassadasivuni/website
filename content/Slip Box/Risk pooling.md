This concept is used extensively in [[insurance]] and relies on the assumption that each individual's [[risk]] is independent of each other. From this assumption, the number of claims a particular [[insurance]] policy will receive can be modelled by the binomial distribution. The standard deviation of this distribution is given below where $n$ is the number of policies and $p$ is the probability of an individual claim.
$$
\text{Standard deviation } = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$
According to the law of large numbers, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, standard deviation $\rightarrow 0$.
