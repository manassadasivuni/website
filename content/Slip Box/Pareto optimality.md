> Pareto optimality is when no further improvements can be made through different decisions without making some party worse off

In [[game theory]], all [[games]] *must* have a Pareto-optimal outcome. Furthermore, there may be multiple Pareto-optimal outcomes in certain [[games]].

In [[Economics]], Pareto optimality just means that resources cannot be allocated in any other way without negatively impacting the [[utility]] of some economic agent.
