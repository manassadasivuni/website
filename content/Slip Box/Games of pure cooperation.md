> [[Games]] where all players have the *exact* same interests

These [[games]] do not have conflict as all players want the same things.
$$
\forall a \in A; \forall i, j, u_i(a) = u_j(a)
$$
As all payoffs are the same, each cell in the matrix only requires one value. An example is picking which side of the road to drive on.

|           | Left | Right |
|:---------:|:----:|:-----:|
| **Left**  | $1$  | $-1$  |
| **Right** | $-1$ | $1$      |

When you drive on the same respective side as the other drivers, the payoff is positive. However, when driving on opposite respective sides, the payoff is negative. The payoff is the same for all players involved regardless of the outcome.
