> Insurance is a contract where a person or entity receives financial protection against a well-defined set of [[Risk|risk]] 



Principles of insurance:
- [[Risk pooling]] is where the safety in insurance comes from
- [[Moral hazard]] occurs when people are insured as they may be incentivised to act dangerously
- [[Selection bias]] is addressed through testing, referrals, and [[government]] insurance

Some country's [[Government]] may provide insurance for insurance companies so that in the event an insurance company goes bankrupt, the policy holders will remain insured. The [[government]] insured amount tends to be lower than the policy value but it is still some protection.
