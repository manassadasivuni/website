> A short sale is the sale of an asset or stock that you do not own. You borrow the stock/asset and immediately sell it and hence "owe" the stock to whoever you borrowed it from. This can also be thought of as owning a *negative* quantity of an asset

This financial instrument is used when the value of an asset is believed to fall. For example, if you short Apple stock when the stock price is $100, when the stock price falls to $75, you can buy back the stock you owe and give to the person who lent it to you. This gives you a profit of $25.

This is not possible in the optimal [[Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)|CAPM]] portfolio as if every investor is shorting a stock, the question of who is lending the stock cannot be answered. As such, while this is impossible in [[Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)|CAPM]], it is possible in real life as investors will have various risk tolerances and goals and hence won't hold the same portfolio.
