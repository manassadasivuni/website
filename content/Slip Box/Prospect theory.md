The centre of the graph is the reference point which continually shifts based on current circumstances. This means that our decision-making is not always consistent with the past. It also means people are more willing to take big risks to escape a loss they incur.

This primarily applies to decisions made under uncertain conditions. In other words, if the outcome of a decision is unknown, we tend to focus on the potential downside of the decision rather than the potential upside equally as much. This is also known as [[Loss aversion]].
