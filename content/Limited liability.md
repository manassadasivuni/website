title: "Limited liability" 
---
> [!SUMMARY]+
> Limited liability is a legal structure that limits the extent to which [[Shareholder|stockholders]] can be pursued for the mistakes of a firm they invest in

This encourages more investment to occur as [[Shareholder|shareholders]] have reduced the [[Risk]] of their investment.

Limited liability *allows* diversified portfolios to occur as the investments made are no longer limited to a few "trustworthy" companies.
