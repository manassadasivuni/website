Hello there, I'm **Manas Sadasivuni**. I am currently in my **first year of the [[_Economics]] course** at [University of Bath](http://bath.ac.uk/). This website is a place where I can share notes that I have written on whichever topic in an unstructured manner known as a **digital garden**.

All the notes contain the same basic structure, but will have varying levels of detail. Some notes might be fully fleshed out while others will be little more than the template. Arguably, the information inside the note is not as important as the information *about* it. The note's name, backlinks and index can often be enough to justify its existence - plus some ideas are self-evident enough to not require explanation.

There are notes with broken contents. All these notes are written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) where I use plugins that render notes with additional information. The obvious example is within any of the [[_Indexes]] or where large [[_Math]] equations aren't displayed properly.

## Entry Points
The only structure that these notes have is that they all lead back to an index. To explore each index, head to the `Backlinks` section to explore related ideas.
