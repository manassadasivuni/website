title: "Gordon Growth Model (GGM)"
alias: GGM, PDV, Present discounted value
---
> [!SUMMARY]+
> The Gordon Growth Model is used to calculate the intrinsic value of an asset in the present based on the expected returns in the future. **This is also known as the Present Discounted Value**

The model only takes the asset price into account and hence is mostly suitable for large companies in stable market which are not easily affected by non-price factors.

$$
PV = \frac{D_1}{r-g}
$$
where:
- $PV$ is present value
- $D_1$ is the value of next year's return
- $r$ is the rate of return
- $g$ is the constant growth rate of the asset

Even if the growth rate of the asset is negative, it will still be worth *something* in the present. Hence, something can be considered a "good" investment if it can be bought for less than the present value.

According to the [[Efficient market theory]], the price of a share is the PDV of its expected dividends. A low $\dfrac{PV}{D_1}$ ratio does not mean that the investment is a **bargain** but that the earnings are forecasted to *decrease* (due to low $g$) or that the [[Risk]] is *high* (high $r$).
