title: "Inflation indexed debt" 
---
> [!SUMMARY]+
> [[Inflation]] indexed [[Debt]] is a type of [[Debt]] where the amount owed is fixed in **real** terms rather than in nominal terms

This ensures that in the event of extreme [[Inflation]], the amount owed is still worth the same or a similar amount. This is achieved by indexing against multiple goods and services rather than a single one to avoid the impacts of price fluctuations by that particular good.

For example, Japan had [[Debt]] contracts where the amount had to be repaid in rice rather than in Yen but the value of the contract was still dependent on fluctuations in the value of rice.
