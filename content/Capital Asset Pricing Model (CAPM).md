> CAPM is a model of the optimal investment portfolio and asserts that all investors will hold the same portfolio

CAPM advocates investing in assets from multiple "tiers" of risks. In other words, a portfolio should contain assets ranging from low [[risk]] [[government]] bonds to speculative assets as *overall* the risk will be balanced across the portfolio.
